## Description
This project aims to provide an opensource alternative to password managing solutions for enhanced security and more flexeblity.
### What's the problem?
Already existing solutions are not open source specifically over android platform which compromises security.
### How can this project help?
This project is planned to provide various layers of security to password management including both local and cloud solutions.
### The idea
The essence is to use locally encrypted file as a backup for password retrieval which if even is hacked from cloud cannot be cracked without users master password.
